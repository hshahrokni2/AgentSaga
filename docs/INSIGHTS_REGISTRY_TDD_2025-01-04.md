# Insights Registry TDD Implementation - Progress Report

## Date: 2025-01-04

## Task: Build Insights Registry with Evidence Linking (ID: ac37fc71-8bc2-423d-bb50-033ba4ca14ae)

## Current Status: RED Phase Complete âœ…

### Overview
Implementing a comprehensive Insights Registry system following Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. The registry will manage insights with human-friendly IDs (INS-YYYY-MM-NNN format) and support evidence linking, clustering, and merge/split operations.

##### âœ… Cross-Supplier Analysis Tests (`TestCrossSupplierClustering`)
- Pattern identification across suppliers
- Systemic vs supplier-specific classification
- Temporal pattern detection

## Test Coverage Summary

### Total Test Methods: 57
- ID Generation: 4 tests
- Clustering: 8 tests
- Evidence Linking: 4 tests
- Merge/Split: 3 tests
- Status/Audit: 3 tests
- Source Attribution: 4 tests
- Markdown Storage: 3 tests
- Search/Performance: 4 tests
- Similarity Metrics: 4 tests
- Hierarchical Clustering: 4 tests
- Cluster Validation: 3 tests
- Cross-Supplier: 3 tests

### Test Verification
All tests properly fail/skip in RED phase as expected:
```bash
pytest tests/backend/test_insights_registry.py -v
# Result: SKIPPED (classes not implemented yet)
```

## Next Steps (GREEN Phase)

### 1. Core Implementation Files to Create:
```
src/services/insights_registry.py
src/services/insights_clustering.py
src/services/evidence_linker.py
src/services/insight_merger.py
```

### 2. Key Classes to Implement:
- `InsightsRegistry` - Main registry class
- `InsightIDGenerator` - ID generation with database sequences
- `InsightClusteringEngine` - Clustering algorithms
- `EvidenceLinker` - Evidence management
- `InsightMerger` - Merge/split operations
- `SimilarityCalculator` - Similarity metrics
- `HierarchicalClustering` - Clustering implementation
- `ClusterValidator` - Quality validation
- `CrossSupplierAnalyzer` - Cross-supplier patterns

### 3. Database Models:
- Already exist in `src/database/models.py`:
  - `Insight` table with INS-YYYY-MM-NNN IDs
  - `InsightLink` table for evidence connections

### 4. Integration Points:
- PostgreSQL with pgvector for embeddings
- AsyncPG for database operations
- NumPy for numerical computations
- SciPy for clustering algorithms

## Test-Driven Benefits Observed

1. **Clear Requirements**: Tests define exact behavior needed
2. **Edge Cases Identified**: Concurrent operations, Swedish characters, temporal patterns
3. **Performance Targets**: <500ms search, <1s filtering
4. **Quality Metrics**: Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index
5. **Audit Compliance**: Full traceability requirements defined

## Swedish Context Considerations

- âœ… Swedish character support in Markdown (Ã¥Ã¤Ã¶ Ã…Ã„Ã–)
- âœ… Swedish supplier naming patterns
- âœ… Temporal patterns (monthly reporting cycles)
- âœ… Cross-supplier analysis for Swedish waste management

## Performance Requirements (from tests)

- ID Generation: Handle concurrent requests
- Search: <500ms for text search
- Filtering: <1s for multi-criteria
- Pagination: Consistent performance across pages
- Clustering: Stability >80% with perturbations

## Compliance Requirements (from tests)

- Full audit trail for all operations
- User attribution tracking
- Evidence integrity validation
- Status transition enforcement
- Immutable audit logs

## Summary

The RED phase has been successfully completed with comprehensive test coverage for the Insights Registry. All 57 test methods are written and properly failing/skipping, providing a solid foundation for GREEN phase implementation. The tests cover all requirements from the Archon task including ID generation, clustering, evidence linking, merge/split operations, and performance targets.

Ready to proceed to GREEN phase implementation! ðŸš€
